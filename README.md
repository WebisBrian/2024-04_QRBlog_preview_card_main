## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Once again, I am proud to have achieved a project close to what was requested.
I learned to use Figma, superficially but it helped me with some margins/paddings.

### Continued development

I had a lot of trouble making the project responsive. I think I arrived at something pretty good, but with the help of what was happening around me. Media queries are therefore a priority.

For the rest, the automation is not yet there and I have been juggling a lot between Figma and VSC to gradually achieve this result.

I also didn't want to spend too much time looking for perfection, preferring to correct the main big mistakes.
